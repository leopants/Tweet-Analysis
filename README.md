# Tweet Analysis

Program that can analyze the last 20 tweets of a user and tag them as positive, 
giving the user their total positive tweets out of the amount checked.

## Running

When compiling one will be asked for a Twitter user's account name. 
Please type the username while emitting the '@'.

## What I Learned

This project introduced me to API by utilizing the Twitter API to run the program.
I also had to import a dictionary for keyword search and an algorithm to implement that feature.
